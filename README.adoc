# coreos-infra

One of the most challenging issues with network infrastructure
services in a corporate environment is the management of updates and
security. CoreOS provides a new way to manage the operation and
updates for critical infrastructure while providing both security and
robustness for both the hosts and the services they run.

## CoreOS for Infrastructure

CoreOS is... a lot of buzzwords. To a first approximation it's a
distribution variant of Fedora Linux. It can run any software that you
could run on Fedora. It can run software containers or virtual
machines.

Then the buzzwords come in: *minimal*, *immutable*, *checkpointed*, or
tuned for *containerized workloads*. CoreOS was originally designed to
run software containers and to decouple the OS functions from the
applications and services. To learn more check out link:./WHY_COREOS.md[The Case for CoreOS].

Here I'm going to treat the utility of CoreOS for infrastructure as a
given and focus on the practice of deploying, configuring and
maintaining common network infrastructure services on CoreOS.

## CoreOS Configuration and Deployment

CoreOS does not have an interactive installer, and it does not use Kickstart, the standard automated Fedora/Red Hat installer. Instead, CoreOS is installed onto the system storage using the `coreos-installer` program and a simplified system configuration schema known as `butane`. Then when the system boots for the first time the configuration is layed into the new system. 

* link:./COREOS_CONFIG.adoc[Create Configuration] +
  Define the customization parameters for a CoreOS instance
* link:./COREOS_PROVISION.adoc[Write Bootable Media] +
  Write the CoreOS image and overlay the customization values
* link:./FIRST_BOOT.adoc[First Boot/Install] +
  Observe the first boot and confirm SSH access

The goal of these steps is just to provision the infrastructure hosts and ensure that they
are accessible over the network using an SSH key to the admin user
account. This is the mechanism that Ansible will use to connect and
define the system services.

## Configuration Management - Ansible

This section glosses setup for Ansible to access the infrastructure
servers in preparation for system service installation and
configuration.

## Network Infrastructure Services

The first services you need on a new network are the ones no one
notices because they define the network. If they're down no one says "oh, DNS is down" they say "The Internet is down". If DHCP is down, users can't get an IP address, and so, again "The Internet is down".

* DNS - Map IP Addresses to hostnames and services
* NTP - Provide trusted time-sync for devices
* DHCP - Map hardware to IP addresses - Provide boot/install information
* PXE (TFTP/HTTP) - provide boot/install payload
* Monitoring - Observe and report activity
* Access Management (RADIUS/TACACS,FreeIPA) - Identify users and resource access

## Service Installation

* NTP - Chrony
* DHCP - TBD
* Monitoring - TBD

* User Management - FreeIPA?
