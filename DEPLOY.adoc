= Deploying CoreOS

There are already a number of good resources for deploying CoreOS to
various systems. See <<references>>. This document focuses on the
particulars of configuring and deploying CoreOS as a base for small
and medium network infrastructure services.

== The Principle of Least Config

In keeping with the minimalist philosophy of CoreOS, the configuration
will apply only those settings necessary to boot the system and
provide remote access and configuration management. The first two are fairly
trivial, but the last involves a bit of system gymnastics.

The CoreOS configuration is applied at first boot and is provided to
the installer when writing the boot media to storage.

            systemctl disable install-overlay-packages

----

=== 1 - Butane Preamble

The Butane configuration schema begins with two values that identify
the target OS and the schema version itself.

[source, yaml]
----
variant: fcos
version: 1.6.0
----

This indicates that the file targets Fedora CoreOS and the schema version is 1.6.0.
This assists the parser in validating the remainder of the configuration against the
indicated schema.

=== 2 - Core User - SSH Public Key

CoreOS deploys with two default users, `root` and `core`. The `root`
user is not intended for direct login. Neither has a password by
default. CoreOS is meant to be accessed by SSH on a network by the
`core` user.

[source, yaml]
----
passwd:
  users:
    - name: core
      ssh_authorized_keys_local:
        - infra-ansible-ed25519.pub
----

The `core` user already exists so no additional parameters need to be
provided. The user definition only specifies a public key file who's
contents will be inserted into the `authorized_keys` file of that
user.

The `ssh_authorized_keys_local` option above consists of a list
of filenames on the local machine that will be merged into the
ignition file during transformation. The directory containing that
file is provided on the `butane` command line using the `--files-dir` argument.

=== 3 - Hostname

When you log into a system it's convenient to see the hostname in the
CLI prompts. It's also good for reviewing logs. The hostname for
Fedora is set using the `/etc/hostname` file.

[source, yaml]
----
storage:
  files:

    - path: /etc/hostname
      contents:
        inline: |
          infra-01.example.com
----

By convention this file contains the fully-qualified domain name of
the host, and the hostname is the first element of the FQDN.

=== 4 - Package Overlay - Install Ansible

This is the first place where CoreOS is properly customized. The goal
is to automate management of the host and service using *Ansible*. The
Fedora Project is agonistic to the user selection of configuration
management software, so no CM software is installed by default. These
two sections create the parts needed to overlay Ansible on first boot
and then reboot so that the Ansible package contents are available.

==== 4a - Overlay Script

The first part of this first-boot process is a shell script placed so
that it can be written and removed after use.

[source, yaml]
----
    - path: /usr/local/bin/install-overlay-packages
      user:
        name: root
      group:
        name: root
      mode: 0755
      contents:
        inline: |
          #!/bin/bash
          if [ -x /usr/bin/ansible ] ; then
            rm /usr/local/bin/install-overlay-packages
            systemctl disable install-overlay-packages
            rm /etc/systemd/system/install-overlay-packages.service
          else
            rpm-ostree install --assumeyes ansible
            systemctl reboot
          fi
----

The first half of this section defines the location, ownership and
permissions of the file. The second half, under the `contents` key
contains the body of this script.

This script checks to see if the ansible binary is present and
executable. If so, then the script removes itself and the systemd
service unit file that triggers the script on boot. If `ansible` is
not present, then the script overlays the Ansible RPM and then
reboots.

This means that the service and hence the script is executed twice. On
first boot it runs the installlation command and reboots. The second
time it detects that `ansible` is present and then disables and
removes itself.

==== 4b - One-time First Boot Service

The CoreOS specification allows the user to define and control the
operation of `systemd` services. This final section defines a service
that executes the script previously defined.

[source, yaml]
----
systemd:
  units:
    - name: install-overlay-packages.service
      enabled: true
      contents: |
        [Unit]
        Description=Install Overlay Packages
        After=systemd-resolved.service
        Before=zincati.service

        [Service]
        Type=oneshot
        ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/install-overlay-packages

        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

This unit file defines when the service should start and what it
should do. The service will run after networking is enabled and the
DNS `resolved` service is running, but before the `zincati` update
service is started. It runs the script defined above but does not
detach as it would for a daemon.

As noted, this unit is deleted by the script when it runs the second
time and detects the presence of the `ansible` binary.
