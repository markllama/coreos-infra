// CoreDNS server by Ansible Playbook
= DNS Service - CoreDNS
https://coredns.io[CoreDNS] was developed for use in
https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] as a light-weight name server for
containerized services. For a small to medium sized network, CoreDNS
is much simpler to configure and operate than any of the production
quality alternatives.
